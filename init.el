;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is my init file (and all of this preamble is here just to stop
;; FlyCheck from complaining).

;;; Code:


;; Added by Package.el.  This must come before configurations of
;; installed packages.  Don't delete this line.  If you don't want it,
;; just comment it out by adding a semicolon to the start of the line.
;; You may delete these explanatory comments.
